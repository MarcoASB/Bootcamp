## Description :eyes:

### Three observable trends based on the data.

* No matter which cities our random program choose, we can see that the graphs always will be similar. From this, we can assume that the comparison between our variables will almost be the same.
* When we compare latitude against max temperature we can see that the cities that have latitude between 20 and 40 have the highest temperature. So we can say that when getting closer to the equator the temperature increases. :fire:
* Cloudiness and humidity appears to be very similar in all latitudes :cloud::sweat_drops:
